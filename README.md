# androidiasi.github.io
This is the code behind [androidiasi.ro](http://androidiasi.ro).  
It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), the thing that also powers Github Pages.  
This is a community maintained site, so feel free to fork, make changes and create pull requests.  
To publish new events you should take a look at [an example](events/_posts/2016-04-05-android-canvas-magic.md) and just make one like it. Events have custom fields at the beginning of the file and they are all needed.

### I like you guys, where can I join?
I'm glad you asked. Join our [discussion group](http://bit.ly/android-iasi) and just come at our next event. We have cookies!
