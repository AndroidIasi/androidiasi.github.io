###### A few words about Tzury

> I've lost my virginity in IT 2 times, first time I've experienced web development and didn't attached to that, but second time I've found the love of my life Android Development. After an experience in Kenya I've noticed that Android can change the world, because it gives access to information to people all over the world even in poor countries.
