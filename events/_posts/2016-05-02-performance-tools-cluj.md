The Android ecosystem has a lot of tools to help us out when it comes to development. We all use Android Studio, gradle and adb, for instance. We need to, as these are essential tools for building our products. But what about the tools that help us diagnose problems in our apps? This session is all about asking 2 very common questions:


- Why is my app stuttering or dropping below 60fps?
- Why are my users telling me that my app drains their batteries?

Most of the times solving a problem means asking the right questions in order to find the right answers. So starting from these 2 questions, with concrete problem-code examples we will be using tools from Google to find our answers.

I don't want it to be a secret, so I'm telling you that the tools we will be using the most will be Traceview and Battery Historian. We will also be looking at Profiling GPU Rendering and Debugging Overdraw.

I know that these tools might look a bit scary or dull but I promise to keep it simple so that you walk away with information you can use at work the next day.

Andrei's slot at CodeCamp Cluj is at 14:00 in Room 7, first floor. More info about CodeCamp Cluj at [http://cluj.codecamp.ro](http://cluj.codecamp.ro)
