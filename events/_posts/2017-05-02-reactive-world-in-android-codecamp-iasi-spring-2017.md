The focus of the presentation will be on the reactive approach in Android.  

The overall agenda of the presentation is at follows:

- Overview of reactive programming
- Reactive approach advantages over an classic approach
- Introducing RxJava in Android
- RxJava in Android applicability
- Combining Java8 features with RxJava
- How to structure applications that approach the reactive way
- Short demo demonstrating the theory and how to use RxJava
 
The presentation will focus on explaining how things work behind the scene and the demo will come as an complementary step in order to show how the theory can be actually put in practice.  
The presentation will require people to have interacted and used Java and Android.
