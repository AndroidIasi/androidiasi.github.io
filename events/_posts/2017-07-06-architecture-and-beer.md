Google IO brought us Architecture Components and official support for Kotlin. Now that we had some time to play around with the new Architecture Components, we can discuss, exchange ideas, express opinions. The story with Kotlin is a bit different, as there are members of our comunity using it in tests or even production applications for some time. We will be discussing about this also.

So the agenda for this meetup is:

- Room for SQL
- Room vs Realm
- LiveData and reactive architecture
- LiveData vs RxJava
- Lifecycle - decoupling Activities
- Kotlin
- Kotlin vs Java + RetroLambda
- Beer vs water 

The format is going to be non-formal and focused on having a good time. If you have any questions, we can answer on our [forum](http://bit.ly/android-iasi).  

See you at Beer Zone, Tuesday at 18:30!
